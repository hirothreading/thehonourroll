            <h2 id="james-c-scott-two-cheers-for-anarchism"><a href="https://press.princeton.edu/titles/9816.html">James C. Scott “Two Cheers for Anarchism”</a></h2>

<p>Probably the most critical text from Scott’s fantastic book. Apologies for the long read, but it is well worth it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Public school was invented more or less at the same time as the large factory under a single roof, and the two institutions bear a strong family resemblance.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The school was, in a sense, a factory for the basic training of the minimal skills of numeracy and literacy necessary for an industrialising society.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Universal public education is, of course, designed to do far more than merely turn out the labour force required by industry. It is as much a political as an economic institution. It is designed to produce a patriotic citizen whose loyalty to the nation will trump regional and local identities of language, ethnicity and religion. The universal citizenship of revolutionary France had its counterpart in universal conscription. Manufacturing such patriotic citizens through the school system was accomplished less through the manifest curriculum than through its language of instruction, its standardisation and its implicit lessons in regimentation, authority and order.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The modern primary and secondary school system has been much altered by changing theories of pedagogy and, most especially, by affluence and the “youth culture” itself. But there is no mistaking its origins in the factory, if not the prison. Compulsory universal education, however democratising in one sense, has also meant that, with few exceptions, the students have to be there. The fact that attendance is not a choice, not an autonomous act, means that it starts out fundamentally on the wrong foot as a compulsory institution, with all the alienation that this duress implies, especially as children grow older.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The great tragedy of the public school system, however, is that it is by and large, a one product factory. This tendency has only been exacerbated by the push in recent decades for standardisation, measurement, testing and accountability. The resulting incentives for students, teachers, principals and whole school districts have had the effect of bending all efforts toward fashioning a standard product that satisfies the criteria the auditors have established.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is this product? It is a certain form of analytical intelligence, narrowly conceived, which can, it is assumed, be measured by tests. We know, of course, that there are many, many skills that valuable and important for a successful society that are not even remotely related to analytical intelligence, among them, artistic talent, imaginative intelligence, mechanical intelligence, musical and dance skills, creative intelligence, emotional intelligence, social skills and ethical intelligence. Some of these aptitudes find a place in extracurricular activities, especially in sports, but not in the measured and graded activities on which so much now depends for students, teachers and schools.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>This monochromatic flattening of education is brought to a kind of apotheosis in educational systems like those in France, Japan, China and Korea, where the exercise culminates in a single examination on which one’s future mobility and life’s chances substantially depend. Here the scramble to get into the best-regarded schools, to find extra-hours tutoring, and to attend special exam-preparation cram courses reaches a fever pitch.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>How ironic it is that I, who write this, and virtually anyone who reads it, are the beneficiaries, the victors, of this rat race.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Those of us who “won” this race are the lifetime beneficiaries of opportunities and privileges that would not likely otherwise have come our way. We are also are likely to carry a lifetime sense of entitlement, superiority, accomplishment and self esteem that comes from this victory. Let us bracket, for the moment, the question of whether this dividend is justified and what it actually means in terms of our value to ourselves and others, and merely note that it represents a fund of social capital that adjusts the odds of financial and status mobility radically in our favour. This is a lifetime privilege extended to perhaps one-fifth at most of those the system turns out.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>And what of the rest? What of the, say, 80 percent who in effect lose the race? They carry less social capital; the odds are adjusted against them. Perhaps as important is the fact that they are likely to carry a lifelong sense of having been defeated, of being less valued, of thinking they are inferior and slow witted. This system effect further adjusts the odds against them. And yet, have we any rational reason to credit the judgements of a system that values such a narrow bandwidth of human talents and measures achievement within this band by the ability to sit successfully for an exam?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Those who do poorly on tests of analytical intelligence may be incredibly talented at one or more of the many forms of intelligence that are neither taught nor valued by the school system. What sort of a system is it that wastes these talents, that sends four-fifths of its students away with a permanent stigma in the eyes of society’s gatekeepers, and perhaps in their own eyes as well? Are the dubious benefits of the privileges and opportunities accorded a presumed “analytical intelligence elite” by this pedagogical tunnel vision worth so much social damage and waste?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Food for thought.</p>

        <p>
            <h2 id="apple-adjusts-entry-level-macbook-configurations">Apple Adjusts Entry-Level MacBook Configurations</h2>

<p>Apple has quietly adjusted its mid-2019 lineup for the <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac/">MacBook, MacBook Air, and MacBook Pro</a>:</p>

<p>The 12-inch MacBook with Retina display is no longer for sale. This shouldn’t be to a surprise to anyone. The 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro does a much better job of being an ultraportable, ultrafast device at a similar price point. Realistically speaking, the 12-inch MacBook was doomed as soon as Intel abandoned its plans to further develop competitive sub 5w and 3w mobile processors.</p>

<p>The 13-inch MacBook Air is now the entry-level MacBook, available from just US$999 (with student discount). This should’ve happened from launch day, but I suppose it’s better late than never. Its Retina display now comes with True Tone technology too.</p>

<p>The 13-inch MacBook Pro with two Thunderbolt 3 ports and <strong>no</strong> Touch Bar – dubbed the MacBook Escape by Apple fans – is no longer available. Again, this should’ve happened with the launch of 2018 MacBook Air.</p>

<p>The new 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar and two Thunderbolt 3 ports is now available from US$1,299. This means that <strong>every</strong> MacBook Pro now comes with Touch ID and the Touch Bar. Hallelujah, we finally have some consistency across the MacBook Pro lineup!</p>

<p>A lot of these changes should’ve happened a long time ago, but perhaps were delayed or deferred until Apple could hit sufficient manufacturing yields and margins.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>
Unfortunately, the entire MacBook lineup still features Apple’s <a href="https://support.apple.com/keyboard-service-program-for-mac-notebooks">much maligned butterfly keyboards</a>, so we’ll have to wait a little while longer to get new keyboards. I expect this to happen either the end of this year, or early next year when Apple moves to a new chassis across its MacBook lineups.</p>

<p>But, we should focus on the positives of today’s shuffling: the MacBook lineup finally makes some damn sense. Students and people who want portable macOS should aim for the MacBook Air, working professionals take the 13-inch MacBook Pro, and content creators and developers can claim the 15-inch MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>Following updates to the iMac, Mac mini, and Mac Pro, 2019 is shaping up to be a great year for the Mac.</p>

<p><em>Edit</em>: HomePod is <strong>finally</strong> <a href="https://www.apple.com/jp/homepod/">available in Japan</a>.</p>

<p>The good news for the Mac doesn’t end. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/07/09/storage-upgrades-price-drop/">As reported by MacRumors</a>, Apple has cut the price of flash storage upgrades across its entire Mac lineup.</p>

<p>Mary Hui at Quarz:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hong Kong’s protesters are using AirDrop, a file-sharing feature that allows Apple devices to send photos and videos over Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, to breach China’s Great Firewall in order to spread information to mainland Chinese visitors in the city.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What an amazing way to avoid the Great Firewall of China, and to spread information in a peaceful way toward their cause. I continue to be impressed and moved by what’s happening in Hong Kong.</p>

<p>I continue to hope that the Hong Kong people achieve further independence, and to protect their democratic rights and freedoms.</p>

<p>From The Atlantic:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s hard to fathom how a group of young American men, most of whom would never have killed anyone but for the Vietnam War, spiralled out of control together, perpetrating atrocities that rival any committed in the annals of human warfare.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>And yet, whenever a country’s civilian leaders decide to send young men to fight any war of sustained length, it is almost certain that discipline will break down somewhere, that savagery will take hold sometime, and that shameful evil will be done, as had happened during the Civil War, World War I, World War II, and the Korean War.</p>

<p>A fantastic piece from The Japan Times, providing a spotlight on Professor Chizuko Ueno and her continuing fight for gender equality in Japan.</p>

<p>Professor Ueno gave a fantastic speech to this year’s graduate intake at The University of Tokyo, reminding the students not to succumb to ivory tower syndrome, and to raise awareness on the single biggest plague and infection in Japanese society, misogyny:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“There are people whose drive is dampened even before they try because of negative comments or thoughts like ‘You won’t succeed no matter what’ or ‘After all, nobody believes in me,’ ” she said. “I hope you won’t focus your efforts only to win the game for yourself.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I hope you will use your gifted talents and favorable environment to help those who are less fortunate, and do not denigrate them. And I hope you live your life by accepting who you are even with your weaknesses and by helping and supporting each other,”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The 70-year-old scholar, who is also a chief director of the nonprofit Women’s Action Network, pointed out that less than 20 percent of students entering the University of Tokyo, better known as Todai, are female. This is despite there being plentiful evidence that female applicants have higher standard scores than their male competitors.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>People often ask me what I think Japan’s greatest crisis is: China and the US, North Korea, rapidly ageing demographics, or maybe deflation and slow GDP growth? No. It’s the blatant double standards and the glass ceiling that women across Japan have to face on a constant basis. Don’t even get me started on the large social costs that this incurs – if we just focus on the economic costs, how many Nobel Prizes, breakthroughs in science and technology, and seismic productivity improvements has Japan lost by failing to ensure an equality of opportunity to the millions of highly intelligent women in this country?</p>

<p>For all of Japan’s obsessions with gaining equal footing with the West from an economic, political, and cultural point of view, it will forever be relegated as second-class so long as women here are treated here as second-class.</p>

<p>By now, you’ve probably already heard about Alabama’s controversial abortion laws, and the absolutely mind boggling case of Marshae Jones. From the New York Times article:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Marshae Jones, was accused of beating up a co-worker who ultimately drew a gun and fired it, wounding Ms. Jones in the stomach and killing her five-month-old fetus. A grand jury in Jefferson County, convened by District Attorney Lynneice Washington, dismissed charges against the co-worker, saying she had acted in self-defense. But it indicted Ms. Jones for “initiating a fight knowing she was five months pregnant.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Under Alabama law, a fetus is considered to have the same rights as a child who has already been born. The grand jury sought to hold someone accountable for its death and Ms. Jones was arrested last week.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After drawing wide spread criticism, and becoming top news in the US, prosecutors announced on Wednesday that they would be dropping the manslaughter charges <strong>against Ms Jones</strong>. The fact that the law was applied in this way, such that a grand jury decided that Ms Jones be held accountable for the loss of her unborn baby, is absolutely insane. I’m legitimately baffled at this entire case, and have to remind myself that this is taking place in the US.</p>

<p>Interesting paper from Owen Zidar (Princeton and the NBER) on the links between income tax cuts and economic activity:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I find that the positive relationship between tax cuts and employment growth is largely driven by tax cuts for lower-income groups and that the effect of tax cuts for the top 10 percent on employment growth is small.</p>

<p>In a nut shell, trickle down economics is rubbish.</p>
