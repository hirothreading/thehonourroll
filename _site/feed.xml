&lt;p&gt;It brings me great pleasure to belatedly announce to my dear friends and family, that I have been officially accepted as a graduate student into the University of Oxford. I will begin my studies at Oxford this September, with a Master of Philosophy (MPhil) in economics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To say that this has been a long time coming would be an understatement. This announcement marks the achievement of a dream and goal that began over six years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, and most importantly, being accepted into Oxford is not due to the efforts of me alone. I cannot stress this enough. I was well and truly supported, motivated, inspired, mentored, and challenged to get this far. The list of people who I wish to extend my most sincere thanks and appreciation is long. Chances are, if you‚Äôre reading this, you are one of the people I wish to thank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To my amazing friends and family I grew up with, laughed with, worked with, and studied with in Perth, Osaka, Canberra, and Tokyo: &lt;strong&gt;Thank you!&lt;/strong&gt; Thank you so much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, I wish to express my most sincere gratitude to Professor Ippei Fujiwara. One of the most dedicated, passionate, sharpest and brightest individuals I‚Äôve ever had the privilege of working with. I hope to continue his legacy and passion for research, teaching, and desire for knowledge. I‚Äôve got big shoes to fill, but I approach the challenge with enthusiasm and boundless optimism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, it is also imperative to keep in mind that this is just another step ‚Äì another journey ‚Äì in the adventure of life. I look forward to discovering, learning, and achieving even bigger and better things ‚Äì with all your support. I am absolutely certain that there will be good times and bad times. Times where I will fall, fail, and make mistakes. I ask that you continue to tolerate, teach, and help me with whatever comes next, together.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">To the Next Adventure</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Hiroshima</title><link href="/2019/08/06/hiroshima.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Hiroshima" /><published>2019-08-06T00:00:00+09:00</published><updated>2019-08-06T00:00:00+09:00</updated><id>/2019/08/06/hiroshima</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2019/08/06/hiroshima.html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;todays-the-day&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hpmmuseum.jp/?lang=eng&quot;&gt;Today‚Äôs the Day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a change of pace, rather than talking about Apple, let‚Äôs talk about Intel (oh boy‚Ä¶). As many who have been following PC hardware recently would know, Intel has been struggling. They‚Äôve been stuck on their 14nm process for years, their Skylake architecture is looking very long in the tooth, their consumer lineup is a horrible mess, AMD has become a very real threat in enterprise and server markets, and x86‚Äôs future remains as uncertain as ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I, however, believe that Intel will make a strong turnaround next year. This will be spearheaded by &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsroom.intel.com/biography/raja-m-koduri/#gs.ta1ti3&quot;&gt;Raja Koduri&lt;/a&gt; leading Intel‚Äôs GPU technology efforts, and semiconductor architect superstar &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anandtech.com/show/13048/an-anandtech-exclusive-the-jim-keller-interview&quot;&gt;Jim Keller&lt;/a&gt; joining the fray too. I anticipate big and significant announcements from Koduri and Keller, who have pulled off miracle after miracle everywhere they‚Äôve been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, more immediate than whatever projects Koduri and Keller are working on, is the upcoming introduction and launch of Intel‚Äôs new CPU microarchitecture. At long last, Skylake has a successor ‚Äì one that will also come out on Intel‚Äôs perhaps still janky 10nm process. Say hello to Sunny Cove.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://hirothreading.github.io/thehonourroll//assets/images/intelsunnycove.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Intel's Sunny Cove microarchitecture&quot; height=&quot;200px&quot; width=&quot;350px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anandtech has prepared a fantastic &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anandtech.com/show/14514/examining-intels-ice-lake-microarchitecture-and-sunny-cove&quot;&gt;deep dive&lt;/a&gt; on Sunny Cove. If you have a free afternoon, I definitely recommend taking a good read. According to this Anandtech report, Intel has rejigged their CPU architecture in dramatic fashion ‚Äì perhaps as big of a change since the Nehalem to Sandy Bridge transition!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Intel can deliver on all their promises, then we‚Äôre looking at some significant performance, power efficiency, and platform/package efficiency gains. Average instruction per-clock gains are predicted to be roughly 18% over Skylake, on-die integration of Thunderbolt 3 (and hence a doubling of PCIe lanes from the CPU die), a revamped cache and memory controller system, and a large increase in GPU resources all point toward a very impressive new architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is, of course, if Intel can deliver on these promises‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Intel‚Äôs New ùõçarch</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Appleq3results</title><link href="/2019/07/31/appleq3results.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Appleq3results" /><published>2019-07-31T00:00:00+09:00</published><updated>2019-07-31T00:00:00+09:00</updated><id>/2019/07/31/appleq3results</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2019/07/31/appleq3results.html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;apples-2019-q3-financial-results&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/07/apple-reports-third-quarter-results/&quot;&gt;Apple‚Äôs 2019 Q3 Financial Results&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sheer scale and strength of this company never ceases to amaze me. Here are the headline figures: $53.8 billion in revenue, $10 billion in net profit, and 37.6% gross margin just for this quarter alone. This is roughly a one per cent increase over the previous year-ago quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These figures are being driven on the back of Mac revenue increasing 11% YoY, iPad revenue up 8% YoY, Services up 13% YoY, and &lt;strong&gt;Wearables up 68% YoY&lt;/strong&gt;. I can only see these figures increasing over the coming year, as Apple continues to fill out these categories with some interesting products such as the new Mac Pro and MacBook Pros.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, &lt;a href=&quot;https://sixcolors.com/post/2019/07/apple-third-quarter-2019-results-and-charts/&quot;&gt;Jason Snell&lt;/a&gt;  over at &lt;a href=&quot;https://sixcolors.com&quot;&gt;sixcolors&lt;/a&gt; has a great graphical representation and breakdown of Apple‚Äôs results.

&lt;p&gt;Add this to the list of things I thought would happen. This is another natural progression of Apple‚Äôs ‚Äì and perhaps more specifically, Tim Cook‚Äôs ‚Äì approach to its platforms and devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Johny Srouji, Apple‚Äôs senior vice president of Hardware Technologies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We‚Äôve worked with Intel for many years and know this team shares Apple‚Äôs passion for designing technologies that deliver the world‚Äôs best experiences for our users. Apple is excited to have so many excellent engineers join our growing cellular technologies group, and know they‚Äôll thrive in Apple‚Äôs creative and dynamic environment. They, together with our significant acquisition of innovative IP, will help expedite our development on future products and allow Apple to further differentiate moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With full control over the CPU, GPU, and now, cellular modem, this will allow Apple to further increase their already dominant lead in hardware performance and efficiency on their devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs been a lot of talk in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anandtech.com/show/14676/apple-to-buy-bulk-of-intels-smartphone-modem-business&quot;&gt;tech media&lt;/a&gt; about how this Intel deal will affect Apple‚Äôs 2020 (and beyond) iPhones ‚Äì particularly iPhone‚Äôs 5G capabilities.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I think a lot of pundits are missing another key opportunity that this buyout presents Apple: the opportunity to miniaturise cellular modems for ultraportable devices and wearables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While iPhone will be the short term benefactor of this deal, I think the bigger winners amongst Apple‚Äôs devices and platforms will be the Apple Watch, AirPods, and perhaps other future yet-to-be-announced wearable devices. The Mac and iPad will also benefit from Apple‚Äôs in-house modems, but to lesser extent as they‚Äôre nowhere near as thermally or physically limited as the iPhone and Apple Watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also believe that this won‚Äôt be the last we hear of Apple‚Äôs desire to control more of the components in its devices. For example, we know that Apple is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-19/apple-is-said-to-develop-displays-to-replace-samsung-screens&quot;&gt;developing MicroLED technology&lt;/a&gt;, with potentially significant benefits across all of its hardware platforms. Phil Schiller has also talked about how important camera technology is to iPhone, and how he views iPhone as the modern-day replacement to the point-and-shoot camera. So we may see Apple make further aggressive moves in the areas of camera technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, this Apple-Intel deal will be a boon to Apple ‚Äì and, more importantly, to Apple‚Äôs customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last month I was invited to a public screening of the BBC produced documentary, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/3z44Njyr5wzm3wbVMGZ7tFr/shiori-ito-japan-s-attitudes-to-allegations-of-sexual-violence-are-locked-in-the-past?fbclid=IwAR0_v4FXCMuaBYGNg_t5KbYoBUisaqSjWbFX7SmpyOonLtqgfEhU6x0fT54&quot;&gt;Japan‚Äôs Secret Shame&lt;/a&gt;. The screening was organised by &lt;a href=&quot;https://telljp.com/?fbclid=IwAR1rAFC4EUCMwhf92pCQ2Qsp7AcwL915fXOhw6SAUXvAuLTpEQ0tE0YxL1g&quot;&gt;tell Japan&lt;/a&gt;, an organisation dedicated to counselling and raising awareness around mental health issues in Japan. They‚Äôre a fantastic organisation, and I recommend everyone to check them out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan‚Äôs Secret Shame tells the story of Shiori Ito, a former journalism student who was studying in New York with ambitions to return to Japan to start her career. While in New York she met Noriyuki Yamaguchi, a senior journalist from broadcaster TBS Japan. Mr Yamaguchi made an informal promise to Ms Ito that he would help with her career once her studies were complete in New York, and after she returned back to Tokyo. Ms Ito, like any enthusiastic young person willing to make their mark on the world, took Mr Yamaguchi up on his offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ms Ito returned to Tokyo once her studies were finished, and she met Mr Yamaguchi in person over dinner. Mr Yamaguchi had other plans for their encounter however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ms Ito alleges that Mr Yamaguchi drugged and raped her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether or not you believe Ms Ito‚Äôs account of events is one thing ‚Äî the documentary isn‚Äôt concerned about that. What the documentary highlights is Japan‚Äôs ridiculously archaic and barbaric legal system, completely inept and unable to support victims of sexual violence ‚Äî whether it be women, men, or ‚Äî tragically ‚Äî children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, the documentary shines a spotlight on the disgusting and idiotic views of politicians such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/09/05/national/lgbt-politicians-condemn-diet-members-slur-lgbt-couples-ask-abe/#.XTg4ri1L3UI&quot;&gt;Mio Sugita&lt;/a&gt; and other media shock jocks, who have done nothing but condemn Ms Ito and the thousands of other Japanese women each year who are brave enough to speak out against rape and sexual violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I strongly urge you all, if you have a spare hour, to watch Japan‚Äôs Secret Shame. It‚Äôs not an easy watch, but it is extremely informative and of critical importance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I viewed it at a public screening, and witnessed the impact it had on the audience. As I turned to the rest of audience after the screening, I noticed that dozens of women were left with hands over their mouths and with tears in their eyes. No doubt this issue ‚Äî this injustice ‚Äî hit close to home for many.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Japan‚Äôs Secret Shame and the Courage of Shiori Ito</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Stevejobs</title><link href="/2019/07/20/stevejobs.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Stevejobs" /><published>2019-07-20T00:00:00+09:00</published><updated>2019-07-20T00:00:00+09:00</updated><id>/2019/07/20/stevejobs</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2019/07/20/stevejobs.html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;steve-jobs-on-rupert-murdoch-and-fox-news--2010&quot;&gt;Steve Jobs on Rupert Murdoch and Fox News  (2010)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs no secret that I am a huge fan of Steve Jobs, and believe that his insights into the tech industry and culture were absolutely brilliant. Here is one of his lesser known quotes that remains as one of my favourites:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The axis today is not liberal and conservative, the axis is constructive-destructive, and you‚Äôve cast your lot with the destructive people. Fox has become an incredibly destructive force in our society. You can be better, and this is going to be your legacy if you‚Äôre not careful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An excellent introduction to semiconductors, CMOS design, and microprocessor architectures by Anandtech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fun fact ‚Äì and some of my friends know this ‚Äì after entering university, I was so close to changing my major to electrical engineering. Having tinkered with PCs throughout high school, and being utterly obsessed with how companies like Intel, AMD, and Nvidia built and designed chip architectures such as NetBurst, Hammer, Conroe, R500, G80, R600, RV770, and so on. I wanted to become a semiconductor/chip architect myself!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was around the time Apple was making its way into designing its own chips too. I recall there being news about how it was custom designing its own A4 System-on-Chip (SoC). The A4 was an amazing SoC, powering the high performance graphics of the iPhone 4‚Äôs Retina display. Apple continued hitting home runs with its custom chip adventures with the A5, A5X, A6, and all the way to today‚Äôs industry leading A12X Bionic SoC inside its iPad Pro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This stuff fascinates me to this day. Intel‚Äôs venerable Skylake architecure (now very long in the tooth), AMD‚Äôs Zen 2 and Navi architectures, IBM‚Äôs POWER8, and Apple‚Äôs SoCs and platform controllers ‚Äì all of it. I spend way too much reading it how these amazing pieces of technology are designed and built.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back when I was an undergrad I decided to give up my dreams on becoming an electrical engineer and chip architect. I was told that I would need to study for at least a decade (B.Eng + M.Sc + PhD) to build up expertise in the area. Even then, I would have to go over the US, Japan, or Taiwan to find a job, and then I would have to compete against graduates from institutions such as CalTech, MIT, and Stanford. I decided that it was too long of a commitment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would, ironically, end up studying economics for over a decade!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">An Introduction to the Semiconductor Industry</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Bingethinking</title><link href="/2019/07/15/bingethinking.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Bingethinking" /><published>2019-07-15T00:00:00+09:00</published><updated>2019-07-15T00:00:00+09:00</updated><id>/2019/07/15/bingethinking</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2019/07/15/bingethinking.html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;binge-thinking-podcast-episode-26-economic-booms-and-busts&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bingethinkingpodcast.com/episodes/2018/2/27/episode-26-economic-booms-and-busts-with-david-murakami?fbclid=IwAR3KsopIrVunDbMvWkblbBTT45L7U7VFO2Q3LhICWAluPXVUeTGJvOZcqyA&quot;&gt;Binge Thinking Podcast Episode 26: Economic Booms and Busts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another gem I found on my Facebook page. My friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://bingethinkingpodcast.com/host&quot;&gt;Caspar Roxburgh&lt;/a&gt; hosts the Binge Thinking podcast:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‚ÄòBinge Thinking‚Äô is a conversation podcast for young intellectuals, activists or just interesting people. Guests share their thoughts on who they are, what they do, and how the modern world looks from their perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The show reveals millennial insights into industries, events, or debates. Listen to smart, funny, eccentric and sometimes outrageous guests you can relate to. If you will live through the next 50 years, hear about those that will be there too. We binge news and current affairs, working life, identity politics, political politics, personal philosophies, relationships and everything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was lucky enough to be invited onto the podcast for its 26th episode back in February 2018. It was a huge blast, and hopefully I can make a return to Caspar‚Äôs show again.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Binge Thinking Podcast Episode 26: Economic Booms and Busts</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Theprophet</title><link href="/2019/07/14/theprophet.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Theprophet" /><published>2019-07-14T00:00:00+09:00</published><updated>2019-07-14T00:00:00+09:00</updated><id>/2019/07/14/theprophet</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2019/07/14/theprophet.html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-prophet-by-kahlil-gibran&quot;&gt;‚ÄúThe Prophet‚Äù by Kahlil Gibran&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A beautiful quote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Your joy is your sorrow unmasked.&lt;br /&gt;
And the selfsame well from which your laughter rises was oftentimes filled with your tears. And how else can it be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The deeper the sorrow that carved into your being, the more joy you can contain. Is not the cup that holds your wine the very cup that was burned in the potter‚Äôs oven?‚Ä® And is not the lute that soothes your spirit the very wood that was hollowed with knives?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When you are joyous, look deep into your heart and you shall find it is only that which has given you sorrow that is giving you joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When you are sorrowful, look again in your heart, and you shall see that in truth you are weeping for that which has been your delight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Some of you say, ‚ÄúJoy is greater than sorrow,‚Äù and other say, ‚ÄúNay, sorrow is the greater.‚Äù&lt;br /&gt;
But I say unto you, they are inseparable. Together they come, and when one sits alone with you at your board, remember that the other is asleep upon your bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Verily you are suspended like scales between your sorrow and your joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Only when you are empty are you at standstill and balanced.&lt;br /&gt;
When the treasure-keeper lifts you to weigh his gold and silver, needs must your joy or your sorrow rise or fall.&lt;/p&gt;
