## [The Changing Face of Economics](https://www.ft.com/content/dac3b1d8-20fc-11ea-b8a1-584213ee7b2b)

An interesting piece by the Financial Times on the evolution of economics over the past century. The article also highlights one of the main challenges of economics: Most people don't know what economics is.

In discussions with friends and colleagues at Oxford, most merely brushed off economics as being a derivative of politics. Some even accuse economics and economists as being partisan. For myself, and most other economists, there are few things more frustrating than being told this. 

Economics is a social science. Like the natural sciences, it can be used as a powerful tool, and it is badly misunderstood by those not well versed or practiced in it. The tragedy for economics is that it has a lot to say about things like money and wealth, which attracts a lot of unwanted attention from politics and those from other humanities disciplines.

>Economics is a controversial discipline, and that is not likely to change. Whereas scientists only occasionally have to dip their toes into political waters such as climate change or vaccination, most of what economists study — from inequality to immigration, trade to taxation — lies squarely in the middle of the political battlefield.

>Still, some of us are doing our best, and all of us are human, as these portraits show. It is nice to be reminded of that.

Economics has a lot to say about a broad range of phenomena that we encounter on a day to day basis. It is the study of common sense and choice, and can help explain anything from dating, international trade, unemployment, black market activity, consumer satisfaction, negotiation, interest rates, and so much more.

Money, wealth, and political-economy, is but a tiny sliver of the discipline of economics.

Finally, there's a quote from Greg Mankiw's essay ["Defending the One Percent"](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/mankiw/files/defending_the_one_percent_1.pdf) which I quite like:

 >At the outset, it is worth noting that addressing the issue of rising inequality necessarily involves not just economics but also a healthy dose of political philosophy. We economists must recognize not only the limits of what we know about inequality’s causes, but also the limits on the ability of our discipline to prescribe policy responses. Economists who discuss policy responses to increasing inequality are often playing the role of amateur political philosopher (and, admittedly, I will do so in this essay). Given the topic, that is perhaps inevitable. But it is useful to keep in mind when we are writing as economists and when we are venturing beyond the boundaries of our professional expertise.

 Conversely, non-economists who discuss economics when considering policy responses to issues are playing with a tool that they may not fully comprehend. They need to be aware of the limits of their own understanding, but also to the limits that economics may have on any particular subject.
