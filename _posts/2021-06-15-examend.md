## End of Oxford MPhil Economics Exams

Today marks the end of my exams (hopefully forever)! 

The MPhil in Economics here at the University of Oxford has been perhaps one of my most challenging undertakings. The difficulty and stress of the programme was exacerbated by the complications brought on by the COVID pandemic. 

I’m not out of the woods yet: I still have to write and submit my Masters dissertation before the 30th of June. 

Additionally, I await the determination by the Department of Economics to see if I am able to proceed onto the doctorate — and then there’s the issue of funding. 

A couple of things I plan to do over the summer holidays (besides the obvious important life stuff): I plan to expand my notes for macroeconomics and econometrics. I’ve been getting quite a lot of people asking me for a guide to getting started with Dynare. So I’ll try and incorporate this into my [1st Year Macroeconomics notes](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12v7HL6Bt6Jhn62YVmNS1MdVs2yYmo0dp/view?usp=sharing). Additionally, I will try and write a bit about solving DSGE models under the ZLB. 

Should be fun. I’ll hopefully try and post more updates here too.
