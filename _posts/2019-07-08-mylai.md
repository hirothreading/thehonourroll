## [The My Lai Massacre](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/03/my-lai-50/555671/?utm_campaign=the-atlantic&utm_content=5c8d2bac4b73850001c4b878_ta&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook&fbclid=IwAR0Qw9VMKkhN49tMQXO2x15SKCjlhjutxMwXpQJPmBQR_0Yp7LzmgeqJfzM)

From The Atlantic:

>It’s hard to fathom how a group of young American men, most of whom would never have killed anyone but for the Vietnam War, spiralled out of control together, perpetrating atrocities that rival any committed in the annals of human warfare.

>And yet, whenever a country’s civilian leaders decide to send young men to fight any war of sustained length, it is almost certain that discipline will break down somewhere, that savagery will take hold sometime, and that shameful evil will be done, as had happened during the Civil War, World War I, World War II, and the Korean War.
