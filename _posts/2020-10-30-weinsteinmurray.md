## [Bret Weinstein has a chat with Douglas Murray](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7LMSZ2xsRs)

This is how a conversation between a "liberal" and a conservative should go.

Edit: I write liberal in quotation marks (in reference to Bret Weinstein) because sometimes Weinstein sometimes has lapses in judgement when he attempts to advocate for progressive ideals -- a failure to see the woods from the trees, if you will. See Michael Brooks' brilliant book *Against the Web* for further explanation.
