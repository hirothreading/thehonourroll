## The Biden Win

With the exception of the political equivalent of the odds of a gamma ray burst obliterating the earth, I am slightly relieved that the Democrats have managed to defeat the GOP and Trump in taking the White House.

I have my long list of issues with the Democrats and a Biden presidency: he's already lining up his cabinet and administration with what looks like a LinkedIn networker's dream: picks from Goldman Sachs, Boston Consulting Group, McKinsey & Co, and a host of other corporate executives. The one small, glimmering point of hope is that he's tapped Rep. Deb Haaland and Professor Janet Yellen for the Interior Secretary and Treasury Secretary roles, respectively.

In addition, it seems like the corporate Democrats have gotten what they wanted from the progressive Democrats -- a very narrow, bitterly fought win -- and are now preparing to cast them aside. AOC has been passed over for a position on the Energy and Commerce Committee, and it seems like Pelosi will avoid any challenges to retain her Speaker position. Good grief.

Establishing a solid progressive platform -- to enact a government and policies to empower the working class -- in US politics remains an unfortunate pipe-dream.

For now, as I head into my field exams, I will take a temporary break from social media. I will have a lot more to comment on from the other side, hopefully as Trump hands over the keys to the White House to Biden.
