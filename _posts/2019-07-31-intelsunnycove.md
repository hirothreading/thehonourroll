## [Intel's New ùõçarch](https://www.anandtech.com/show/14514/examining-intels-ice-lake-microarchitecture-and-sunny-cove)

In a change of pace, rather than talking about Apple, let's talk about Intel (oh boy...). As many who have been following PC hardware recently would know, Intel has been struggling. They've been stuck on their 14nm process for years, their Skylake architecture is looking very long in the tooth, their consumer lineup is a horrible mess, AMD has become a very real threat in enterprise and server markets, and x86's future remains as uncertain as ever.

I, however, believe that Intel will make a strong turnaround next year. This will be spearheaded by [Raja Koduri](https://newsroom.intel.com/biography/raja-m-koduri/#gs.ta1ti3) leading Intel's GPU technology efforts, and semiconductor architect superstar [Jim Keller](https://www.anandtech.com/show/13048/an-anandtech-exclusive-the-jim-keller-interview) joining the fray too. I anticipate big and significant announcements from Koduri and Keller, who have pulled off miracle after miracle everywhere they've been.

But, more immediate than whatever projects Koduri and Keller are working on, is the upcoming introduction and launch of Intel's new CPU microarchitecture. At long last, Skylake has a successor -- one that will also come out on Intel's perhaps still janky 10nm process. Say hello to Sunny Cove.

Anandtech has prepare a fantastic [deep dive](https://www.anandtech.com/show/14514/examining-intels-ice-lake-microarchitecture-and-sunny-cove) on Sunny Cove. If you have a free afternoon, I definitely recommend taking a good read. According to this Anandtech report, Intel has rejigged their CPU architecture in dramatic fashion -- perhaps as big of a change since the Nehalem to Sandy Bridge transition!

If Intel can deliver on all their promises, then we're looking at some significant performance, power efficiency, and platform/package efficiency gains. Average instruction per-clock gains are predicted to be roughly 18% over Skylake, on-die integration of Thunderbolt 3 (and hence a doubling of PCIe lanes from the CPU die), a revamped cache and memory controller system, and a large increase in GPU resources all point toward a very impressive new architecture.

That is, of course, if Intel can deliver on these promises...
