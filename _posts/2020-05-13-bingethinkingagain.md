## [Caspar Invites Me to Binge Thinking Again](https://bit.ly/B_Think60)

My friend over at the Binge Thinking Podcast, Caspar Roxburgh, invited myself and health economist Jay Stiles back onto the show to discuss some of the economics of the COVID-19 pandemic.

It was a tonne of fun, and like [last time](https://bingethinkingpodcast.com/episodes/2018/2/27/episode-26-economic-booms-and-busts-with-david-murakami), we had so much to talk about even at the end of the chat.

Here's hoping for round 3 someday. But in the meantime, definitely check out the Binge Thinking Podcast.
