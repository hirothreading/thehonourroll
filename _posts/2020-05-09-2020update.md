## 2020 Update

Five months into 2020, and I haven't made a single update. Time to change that!

There are a few announcements I'd like to make. First, I am happy to announce that I have finished the first-draft manuscript for my first-year MPhil Macroeconomics course. If you're curious to see what kind of material an Oxford first-year MPhil Economics student covers in their macroeconomics course, or if you would like to perhaps have another set of notes, then please feel free to download and share the notes as you see fit. Heck, if you're just generally curious to know what I actually study then please feel free to have a browse (I can't guarantee that you'll be entertained, however).

A couple things that I would like to mention though: These notes are really a collection of notes and material that I've been taught not just here in Oxford, but also as a student at Keio and UWA. I stand on the shoulders of giants, and my only real contribution was to collate, order, and typify what I've learnt. I've also relied on publicly available notes, and have referred them throughout the document. I encourage those interested to read their work too.

I'll most likely make amendments and additions to these notes going forward. Over the next couple weeks, I might make some further additions to the macro-finance part. But for now, I'm happy with what's there. I would also be especially grateful for any feedback or advice to help improve these notes.

The notes are available under the "Resources" tab on this blog. But, for convenience, here they are:

Secondly, yes, I'll be making some more notes and releasing additional exercises/problem sets over the next couple months. I don't think I'll be embarking on any attempts to make a 700-page reader for microeconomics (it's by far my weakest subject), but I might do something more rudimentary.  

Third, I have a lot of thoughts to share on the COVID-19 crisis. I'm not quite sure what medium would be best to get these thoughts out -- they're a bit too long for a blog post. On that note, however, my friend Caspar Roxburgh invited me back onto his podcast, [The Binge Thinking Podcast](https://bingethinkingpodcast.com) (highly recommend checking him out), where I was joined by another fellow economist, Jay Stiles, to talk about the economics surrounding the COVID-19 crisis. It was great fun, and I will share the podcast as soon as it's made available. So stay tuned for that.  

Fourth, I'll try and do better at making more posts. The study here at Oxford is quite intense, so being able to get into the right mindset for free writing has been difficult.  

Anyway, more updates to come soon.
