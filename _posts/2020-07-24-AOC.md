## [Bravo to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LI4ueUtkRQ0)

This woman is absolutely brilliant.

You can disagree with some of AOC's policy proposals, or sometimes loose understanding of economic theory, but you cannot deny that AOC has her heart in the right place. She is a very refreshing, and much needed voice, in our politics.

I hope she spurs on and encourages many other young people -- both women and men -- to participate in politics more.
