## Reflecting on Action

A lot of people are feeling anger, confusion, and sorrow over what we've seen come out of the US over the past week or so. It is the result and culmination of decades -- perhaps centuries -- of systematic flaws and inequalities that many of our societies are built upon.   

It is also the time for reflection, contemplation, and a plan for future action.  

If you have done nothing but post selfies and beach shots of yourself on Instagram for most of your adult life, while participating in the mass consumerism which has upheld the unequal structural makeup of our societies, it would be extremely naive and stupid to think that posting a pitch-black square on social-media absolves you of any guilt or indirect responsibility to the suffering that many disenfranchised people face.  

If you think that the US or Americans are no longer justified in criticising the treatment of, say, pro-democracy advocates in Hong Kong as a result of their domestic political turmoil, then you're an idiot.  

If you're gloating and acting smug just because you're not American or not living in the US, then you're an idiot.  

If you believe that a Wall Street-listed corporation actually gives a damn about the plight of minorities or the poor just because they put their logo in white text on a black background .jpeg file, then you're a fool and part of the problem.  

Before watching the shocking footage of George Floyd being murdered in cold blood, what did you *do* to try and change the systematic injustices in our society? Did you write to your political representatives? Did you even vote? Did you support local business owned and run by members in the community? Did you donate any money to local charities? Did you volunteer? Did you speak up when you witnessed an act of racism? Did you even try to talk to your friends and family about racial injustice?  

What did you actually do? What could you have done?  

...or did you just simply continue to purchase clothes and shoes made in sweat-shops in South East Asia, eat junk food which runs its supply chains on unethical mass-farming delivered by an immigrant working on minimum wage, cross the road when you saw a black or brown man walking toward you, go on a trip to a third-world country, and take another bikini shot on a beach celebrating how blessed and beautiful life is?  

So, go ahead and post that pitch-black square on Instagram or Twitter or Facebook. That's fine. But just know that it does absolutely nothing for those that need help and support. Contemplate what you've done -- or haven't done thus far -- and think about what actionable steps you can take to make a change.
