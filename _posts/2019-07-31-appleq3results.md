## [Apple's 2019 Q3 Financial Results](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/07/apple-reports-third-quarter-results/)

The sheer scale and strength of this company never ceases to amaze me. Here are the headline figures: $53.8 billion in revenue, $10 billion in net profit, and 37.6% gross margin just for this quarter alone. This is roughly a one per cent increase over the previous year-ago quarter.

These figures are being driven on the back of Mac revenue increasing 11% YoY, iPad revenue up 8% YoY, Services up 13% YoY, and **Wearables up 68% YoY**. I can only see these figures increasing over the coming year, as Apple continues to fill out these categories with some interesting products such as the new Mac Pro and MacBook Pros.

As always, [Jason Snell](https://sixcolors.com/post/2019/07/apple-third-quarter-2019-results-and-charts/)  over at [sixcolors](https://sixcolors.com) has a great graphical representation and breakdown of Apple's results. Check it out if you have time.
