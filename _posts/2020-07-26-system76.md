## [System76](https://system76.com)

If the software I need won't make the jump to from x86-64 to Apple ARM, then I think my next computer will be from System76.

Their website is so easy to navigate -- very Apple-like -- and their devices are so clean. Free from the all stupid, garish RGB-nonsense that has plagued most other PC manufacturers.

My only remaining wish would be that they offer AMD Radeon GPUs instead of Nvidia's solutions. But, I guess they have to cater to the CUDA-Linux crowd.
