## [Facebook has another Privacy Breach](https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/04/facebook-phone-numbers-exposed/)

Another day, another Facebook user data and privacy breach. From the techcrunch article:

>The exposed server contained more than 419 million records over several databases on users across geographies, including 133 million records on U.S.-based Facebook users, 18 million records of users in the U.K., and another with more than 50 million records on users in Vietnam.

>But because the server wasnâ€™t protected with a password, anyone could find and access the database.

This is getting absolutely ridiculous. You would have to be insane to trust Facebook with any of your private data, let alone a hotdog stand.

Also, just to remind you all: Facebook owns Instagram and Whatsapp too. Whatever data you have on those platforms isn't safe either.
