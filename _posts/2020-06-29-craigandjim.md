## People I'm a Fan Of: Craig Federighi and Jim Keller

In a change of pace of what I would usually post about, I wanted to share two people that I'm a huge fan of: Craig Federighi and Jim Keller.

Craig is the Senior Vice President of Software Engineering at Apple. He is a natural leader with an impactful stage presence, a great sense of humour, and oodles of charisma. But more than that, Craig seems to truly understand Apple as a company, its customer base, and the future of compute.

Jim is a chip architect, whose resum√© includes AMD, Apple, Tesla, and Intel. Jim is more of a nomad fixer. His tenure at each company is only for a few years. He comes in, identifies problems, sets a new trajectory, implements his vision, ensures that products are launched, and then leaves. Success seems to follow everywhere he goes. Jim was a chief designer of AMD's K8 "Hammer" 64-bit architecture, Apple's A4 and A5 chips, and AMD's "Zen" microarchitecture during his second tenure at the company. What's most interesting about Jim is that he doesn't overstay his visit. He often leaves once the product design has been complete, just before the product receives commercial success. He's simply interested in fixing problems and designing great products.

What's remarkable about these two men is that not only are they amazing at the day-to-day tasks required of their jobs, but they have an amazing macro-perspective of where their industries are heading. Craig is responsible for Apple's decision to take a spearheaded approach to developing separate operating systems for iPhone, iPad, and the Mac -- an approach that was ridiculed by many Windows-pundits in the early 2010s, but has since paid off in dividends. Meanwhile, Jim's architectural design decisions have allowed devices such laptops, servers, and smartphones to undergo massive leaps in performance-per-watt. Suffice to say, Apple's current success with its ARM-based A-series processors, and AMD's hugely popular Ryzen, Threadripper, and EPYC CPU lineups, are all based on Jim's design principles. I am really interested to see the fruits of Jim's labour at Intel over the next few years.   

You've probably seen Craig on stage at Apple's WWDC keynotes. But he also gave a [talk at UC Berkeley's engineering department](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43sjym5ZS68&feature=youtu.be) late last year. Jim also gave a [talk at UC Berkeley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIG9ztQw2Gc), and was a [guest on the AI podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb2tebYAaOA). These are fascinating talks, and if you have any interest in computing -- or leadership -- I highly recommend listening to them.
