## [The Trump Card](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-2020-us-election-third-term-tim-wirth-white-house-a9600486.html)

Tim Wirth, a former Senator from Colorado originally published an op-ed in [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/how-trump-could-lose-election-still-remain-president-opinion-1513975) in July earlier this year, outlining a *House of Cards*-like scenario where Donald Trump remains in power despite losing the Electoral College vote. It's worth a read and serious consideration, and the main thesis is as follows.

>According to Mr Wirth, should Mr Trump lose in a scenario where challenger Joe Biden beats him by "decent but not overwhelming" margins in the swing states of Arizona, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, Mr Trump will declare that the vote was rigged.

>He will supposedly blame mail-in ballots and Chinese election interference for the loss and invoke emergency powers to launch a Justice Department investigation into alleged "election hacking" in the swing states.

>From there, Mr Wirth claims Mr Trump will stall until 14 December, which is the date when states must appoint their US Electoral College electors. Because the swing states [State Legislatures] are each controlled by Republicans, Mr Wirth believes the state legislatures will refuse to certify their electors until the election hacking investigation is finished.

>He then claims the Democrats will challenge the investigation and the challenge to the election, which will eventually be taken to the US Supreme Court. Mr Wirth believes the Supreme Court will rule against the Republicans, but will concede that Mr Trump's emergency powers authorise him to continue his investigation. The Supreme Court will also maintain that should the swing states not be able to certify their selectors by 14 December - for any reason - then the Electoral College will have to meet and vote for the president without the swing states included.

>Under Mr Wirth's theory, the Electoral College will then meet without the swing states under investigation, and neither candidate will receive enough votes to secure the presidency. According to Mr Wirth, the contested election would then move to the House of Representatives, where each delegation gets to cast one vote towards the presidency.

>Since there are more Republican controlled House delegations than Democratic controlled delegations - 26 Republican to 23 Democrats - the Republicans will be the victors of the vote and Mr Trump will remain in office.

>Mr Wirth claims the plot is not far-fetched, and points to Mr Trump's threat to invoke the Insurrection Act of 1807 to use the US military against demonstrators at the George Floyd protests, but notes later on that the "recent resistance of our military establishment is an encouraging sign and necessary component of the 'people's firewall'".

Things are already falling into place for Trump and the GOP to execute this plan.

This was why winning the 2016 election was so absolutely crucial for Democrats. They will rue the day that they decided to put the fate of their party -- and its supporters -- into the failed, decrepit hands of neoliberalism and neoconservatism. The 2016 defeat led to three conservative Supreme Court Justices being nominated to the US Supreme Court, who will most likely rule favourably to whatever scheme the GOP puts forward.

Bernie Sanders with a real progressive, popularist platform would have defeated Trump in 2016, and he would've demolished Trump in this election. The fact that this election was so close should be a sign of significant failure for the Democrats. This was the easiest election to win (for either side) in modern political history. It was an open layup, and the Democrats blew it. Not just once, but twice.
