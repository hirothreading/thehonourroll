## Steve Jobs on Rupert Murdoch and Fox News  (2010)

It's no secret that I am a huge fan of Steve Jobs, and believe that his insights into the tech industry and culture were absolutely brilliant. Here is one of his lesser known quotes that remains as one of my favourites:

>The axis today is not liberal and conservative, the axis is constructive-destructive, and you’ve cast your lot with the destructive people. Fox has become an incredibly destructive force in our society. You can be better, and this is going to be your legacy if you’re not careful.
