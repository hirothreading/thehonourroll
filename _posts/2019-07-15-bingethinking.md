## [Binge Thinking Podcast Episode 26: Economic Booms and Busts](https://bingethinkingpodcast.com/episodes/2018/2/27/episode-26-economic-booms-and-busts-with-david-murakami?fbclid=IwAR3KsopIrVunDbMvWkblbBTT45L7U7VFO2Q3LhICWAluPXVUeTGJvOZcqyA)

Another gem I found on my Facebook page. My friend [Caspar Roxburgh](https://bingethinkingpodcast.com/host) hosts the Binge Thinking podcast:

>‘Binge Thinking’ is a conversation podcast for young intellectuals, activists or just interesting people. Guests share their thoughts on who they are, what they do, and how the modern world looks from their perspective.

>The show reveals millennial insights into industries, events, or debates. Listen to smart, funny, eccentric and sometimes outrageous guests you can relate to. If you will live through the next 50 years, hear about those that will be there too. We binge news and current affairs, working life, identity politics, political politics, personal philosophies, relationships and everything else.

I was lucky enough to be invited onto the podcast for its 26th episode back in February 2018. It was a huge blast, and hopefully I can make a return to Caspar's show again.
