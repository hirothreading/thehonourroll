## [Apple Purchases Intel's Modem Business](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/07/apple-to-acquire-the-majority-of-intels-smartphone-modem-business/)

Add this to the list of things I thought would happen. This is another natural progression of Apple's -- and perhaps more specifically, Tim Cook's -- approach to its platforms and devices.

Johny Srouji, Apple’s senior vice president of Hardware Technologies:
>We’ve worked with Intel for many years and know this team shares Apple’s passion for designing technologies that deliver the world’s best experiences for our users. Apple is excited to have so many excellent engineers join our growing cellular technologies group, and know they’ll thrive in Apple’s creative and dynamic environment. They, together with our significant acquisition of innovative IP, will help expedite our development on future products and allow Apple to further differentiate moving forward.

With full control over the CPU, GPU, and now, cellular modem, this will allow Apple to further increase their already dominant lead in hardware performance and efficiency on their devices.

There's been a lot of talk in the [tech media](https://www.anandtech.com/show/14676/apple-to-buy-bulk-of-intels-smartphone-modem-business) about how this Intel deal will affect Apple's 2020 (and beyond) iPhones -- particularly iPhone's 5G capabilities.[^1] I think a lot of pundits are missing another key opportunity that this buyout presents Apple: the opportunity to miniaturise cellular modems for ultraportable devices and wearables.

While iPhone will be the short term benefactor of this deal, I think the bigger winners amongst Apple's devices and platforms will be the Apple Watch, AirPods, and perhaps other future yet-to-be-announced wearable devices. The Mac and iPad will also benefit from Apple's in-house modems, but to lesser extent as they're nowhere near as thermally or physically limited as the iPhone and Apple Watch.

I also believe that this won't be the last we hear of Apple's desire to control more of the components in its devices. For example, we know that Apple is [developing MicroLED technology](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-19/apple-is-said-to-develop-displays-to-replace-samsung-screens), with potentially significant benefits across all of its hardware platforms. Phil Schiller has also talked about how important camera technology is to iPhone, and how he views iPhone as the modern-day replacement to the point-and-shoot camera. So we may see Apple make further aggressive moves in the areas of camera technology.

In any case, this Apple-Intel deal will be a boon to Apple -- and, more importantly, to Apple's customers.
