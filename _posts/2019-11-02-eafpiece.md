## [Japan's Part Time Workers Need Tighter Reforms](https://www.eastasiaforum.org/2019/11/02/japans-part-time-workers-need-tighter-reforms/)

My recent piece published over at the [East Asia Forum](https://www.eastasiaforum.org) on Japan's labour challenges and the implications it may have on productivity, prices, and interest rates.

> wages and prices may rise if workers can remain productive well into their old age. But achieving this is no trivial task. Both public and private initiatives must be put in place to retrain and re-skill older workers. Where feasible and productive, allowing workers to continue full-time employment into their older years ought to be encouraged.

Many thanks go to the editorial team at the EAF for this piece.
