## [Japan's Secret Shame and the Courage of Shiori Ito](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/29/world/asia/japan-rape.html)

Last month I was invited to a public screening of the BBC produced documentary, [Japan’s Secret Shame](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/3z44Njyr5wzm3wbVMGZ7tFr/shiori-ito-japan-s-attitudes-to-allegations-of-sexual-violence-are-locked-in-the-past?fbclid=IwAR0_v4FXCMuaBYGNg_t5KbYoBUisaqSjWbFX7SmpyOonLtqgfEhU6x0fT54). The screening was organised by [tell Japan](https://telljp.com/?fbclid=IwAR1rAFC4EUCMwhf92pCQ2Qsp7AcwL915fXOhw6SAUXvAuLTpEQ0tE0YxL1g), an organisation dedicated to counselling and raising awareness around mental health issues in Japan. They’re a fantastic organisation, and I recommend everyone to check them out.

Japan’s Secret Shame tells the story of Shiori Ito, a former journalism student who was studying in New York with ambitions to return to Japan to start her career. While in New York she met Noriyuki Yamaguchi, a senior journalist from broadcaster TBS Japan. Mr Yamaguchi made an informal promise to Ms Ito that he would help with her career once her studies were complete in New York, and after she returned back to Tokyo. Ms Ito, like any enthusiastic young person willing to make their mark on the world, took Mr Yamaguchi up on his offer.

Ms Ito returned to Tokyo once her studies were finished, and she met Mr Yamaguchi in person over dinner. Mr Yamaguchi had other plans for their encounter however.

Ms Ito alleges that Mr Yamaguchi drugged and raped her.

Whether or not you believe Ms Ito’s account of events is one thing — the documentary isn’t concerned about that. What the documentary highlights is Japan’s ridiculously archaic and barbaric legal system, completely inept and unable to support victims of sexual violence — whether it be women, men, or — tragically — children.

Further, the documentary shines a spotlight on the disgusting and idiotic views of politicians such as [Mio Sugita](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/09/05/national/lgbt-politicians-condemn-diet-members-slur-lgbt-couples-ask-abe/#.XTg4ri1L3UI) and other media shock jocks, who have done nothing but condemn Ms Ito and the thousands of other Japanese women each year who are brave enough to speak out against rape and sexual violence.

I strongly urge you all, if you have a spare hour, to watch Japan’s Secret Shame. It’s not an easy watch, but it is extremely informative and of critical importance.

I viewed it at a public screening, and witnessed the impact it had on the audience. As I turned to the rest of audience after the screening, I noticed that dozens of women were left with hands over their mouths and with tears in their eyes. No doubt this issue — this injustice — hit close to home for many.
