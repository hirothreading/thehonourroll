## [Bret Weinstein's DarkHorse Podcast: Black Intellectual Roundtable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHGt733yw3g&t=828s)

I could listen to [Bret Weinstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bret_Weinstein) (and [Eric Weinstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Weinstein) -- I only recently found out that the two are brothers) anytime. This was no different -- what an amazingly refreshing, thought provoking discussion. If you have a spare two-hours, and are in dire need of something intelligent and cogent to listen to, I have no reservations in recommending this podcast episode.

In addition, if you want to binge even more good discussion, then check out the following JRE episodes with [Bret Weinstein](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRCzZp1J0v0&t=33s) -- and, [Eric Weinstein](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EWCN3CPhTI).
