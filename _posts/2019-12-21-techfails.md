## [84 of the Biggest Tech Fails of the Decade](https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21029499/decade-fails-flops-tech-science-culture-apple-google-data-kickstarter-2010-2019)

A great piece by The Verge which looks at some of the biggest fails and flops in the technology industry. A few things standout: Look at how many entries Google has on this list -- a clear sign that the company lacks focus and vision (we can soon add Stadia to this list too); I would also add the 2013 Mac Pro and Apple's neglect of the Mac platform for a good five years (although [significant amendments](https://www.apple.com/mac/) have been made in the final year of the decade by Apple); and, the tech industry's utter failure in protecting user privacy, and over-reliance on Chinese manufacturing.
