## [Tax Cuts for Whom?](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/701424?fbclid=IwAR3INhQR8CBX_IxamQYb_Y2ZyusCHzwfBw4L9GcEdMVFb8K9GI7lY1YaAoU)

Interesting paper from Owen Zidar (Princeton and the NBER) on the links between income tax cuts and economic activity:

> I find that the positive relationship between tax cuts and employment growth is largely driven by tax cuts for lower-income groups and that the effect of tax cuts for the top 10 percent on employment growth is small.

In a nut shell, trickle down economics is rubbish.
