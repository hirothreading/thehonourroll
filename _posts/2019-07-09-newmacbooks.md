## Apple Adjusts Entry-Level MacBook Configurations

Apple has quietly adjusted its mid-2019 lineup for the [MacBook, MacBook Air, and MacBook Pro](https://www.apple.com/mac/):

The 12-inch MacBook with Retina display is no longer for sale. This shouldn't be to a surprise to anyone. The 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro does a much better job of being an ultraportable, ultrafast device at a similar price point. Realistically speaking, the 12-inch MacBook was doomed as soon as Intel abandoned its plans to further develop competitive sub 5w and 3w mobile processors.

The 13-inch MacBook Air is now the entry-level MacBook, available from just US$999 (with student discount). This should've happened from launch day, but I suppose it's better late than never. Its Retina display now comes with True Tone technology too.

The 13-inch MacBook Pro with two Thunderbolt 3 ports -- dubbed the MacBook Escape by Apple fans -- is no longer available. Again, this should've happened with the launch of 2018 MacBook Air.

The 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar and four Thunderbolt 3 ports is now available from US$1,299. This means that *every* MacBook Pro now comes with four Thunderbolt 3 ports, Touch ID, and the Touch Bar. Hallelujah, we finally have some consistency across the MacBook Pro lineup!

A lot of these changes should've happened a long time ago, but perhaps were delayed or deferred until Apple could hit sufficient manufacturing yields and margins.[^1]
Unfortunately, the entire MacBook lineup still features Apple's [much maligned butterfly keyboards](https://support.apple.com/keyboard-service-program-for-mac-notebooks), so we'll have to wait a little while longer to get new keyboards. I expect this to happen either the end of this year, or early next year when Apple moves to a new chassis across its MacBook lineups.

But, we should focus on the positives of today's shuffling: the MacBook lineup finally makes some damn sense. Students and people who want portable macOS should aim for the MacBook Air, working professionals take the 13-inch MacBook Pro, and content creators and developers can claim the 15-inch MacBook Pro.

Following updates to the iMac, Mac mini, and Mac Pro, 2019 is shaping up to be a great year for the Mac.
