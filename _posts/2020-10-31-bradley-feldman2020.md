From the abstract of *Hidden Baggage: Behavioral Responses to Changes in Airline Ticket Tax Disclosure*:

>We examine the impact of a January 2012 enforcement action by the US Department of Transportation that required US air carriers and online travel agents to modify their web interfaces to incorporate all ticket taxes in up-front, advertised fares. We show that the more prominent display of tax-inclusive prices is associated with significant reductions in consumer tax incidence, demand, and ticket revenues along more heavily taxed itineraries.

But who needs regulation, right?
