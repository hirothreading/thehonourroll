## Determinism

Have you ever had a moment of apparent serendipity or bizarre coincidence -- or series of these events -- which just takes you aback, and makes you wonder if there is such a thing as fate or destiny?

Recently, over a coffee with a few friends, I was discussing the idea or notion that none of us have true free will. The implications of this argument being true are quite significant. If we all follow some kind of deterministic path, then are some of us destined to be good and some of us bad?

Of course, one could point out the mechanics of quantum physics as proof that, ultimately (albeit on the sub-atomic scale), nothing is determined -- everything is random and probabilistic.

The truth is perhaps, as usual, somewhere in the middle. We all have true free will, but in a sandbox. Where that sandbox is going, and just how far the parameters and boundary of the sandbox are, may be beyond the control of any individual.
