## T-Minus 10

10 days to go before I leave Japan for the UK. My gosh, time flies. Sometimes I still struggle to believe that I've been in Japan for this long.

Perth, and the suburbs of Joondalup and Clarkson, seem so far away now...

I also have little idea where I'll end up after the UK. When I'm asked where I plan on being after the UK I usually answer:
"Hopefully somewhere interesting, or a place where I'm happy."
