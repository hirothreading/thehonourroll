## Donald J. Trump will win the 2020 US Presidential Election

A week before the 2020 US Presidential election, and I predict that Donald J. Trump will be re-inaugurated as the President of the United States for a second term.

I hope to write a piece one day that explains why I made this prediction. I believe there are societal, cultural, and economic trends which continue to elude and confound contemporary liberals, progressives, and the left-wing in the West.

Now is the time, I believe, for the left-wing to be revolutionised. I propose "neoprogressivism" to address the needs of the working class -- the suffering majority -- to combat the cancerous influence of neoliberalism and neoconservatism.
