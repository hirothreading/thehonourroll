## [Hong Kong Protestors use AirDrop Brilliantly](https://qz.com/1660460/hong-kong-protesters-use-airdrop-to-breach-chinas-firewall/)
Mary Hui at Quarz:

>Hong Kong’s protesters are using AirDrop, a file-sharing feature that allows Apple devices to send photos and videos over Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, to breach China’s Great Firewall in order to spread information to mainland Chinese visitors in the city.

What an amazing where to avoid the Great Firewall of China, and to spread information in a peaceful way for their cause. I continue to be impressed and moved by what's happening in Hong Kong.

I continue to hope that the Hong Kong people achieve further independence, and to protect their democratic rights and freedoms.
