## [Facebook Listens to and Transcribes your Messenger Calls](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-13/facebook-paid-hundreds-of-contractors-to-transcribe-users-audio)

In news that is surprising to nobody, Bloomberg reports that Facebook has been hiring external contractors to listen to and transcribe private conversations on its popular Messenger app. Facebook defends its actions by saying that companies such as Amazon, Apple, and Google do the same thing. Unfortunately for Facebook and Zuckerberg, things are not that simple.

A recent report from [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/26/apple-contractors-regularly-hear-confidential-details-on-siri-recordings) revealed that Apple listened to a small sample of audio recordings; but only of customers interacting with Siri. Google too was [caught red handed](https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/20/17594802/google-home-how-to-delete-conversations-recorded) recording Google Home and "OK Google!" interactions, and at a much larger scale than what Apple did with Siri. Amazon was the [worst offender](https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/3/7/17092334/amazon-alexa-devices-strange-laughter), as it was revealed that its Echo speakers consistently listened to everything users said.

But, there is still a big difference between Facebook, and Amazon, Apple, and Google. The latter used voice recordings of customers interacting with their AI voice assistants, while Facebook actually listens to your private conversations with other people. It's actually a pretty stark difference.

This is just another reason, on an ever growing list, to take digital privacy seriously.
