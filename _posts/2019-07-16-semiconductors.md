## [An Introduction to the Semiconductor Industry](https://www.anandtech.com/show/8223/an-introduction-to-semiconductor-physics-technology-and-industry?fbclid=IwAR1g-nfpxIPwjx0edQYmRl3mv6psyFSliSx14WJ9x1qYMhENqRbkMSFULhE)

An excellent introduction to semiconductors, CMOS design, and microprocessor architectures by Anandtech.

Fun fact -- and some of my friends know this -- after entering university, I was so close to changing my major to electrical engineering. Having tinkered with PCs throughout high school, and being utterly obsessed with how companies like Intel, AMD, and Nvidia built and designed chip architectures such as NetBurst, Hammer, Conroe, R500, G80, R600, RV770, and so on. I wanted to become a semiconductor/chip architect myself!

This was around the time Apple was making its way into designing its own chips too. I recall there being news about how it was custom designing its own A4 System-on-Chip (SoC). The A4 was an amazing SoC, powering the high performance graphics of the iPhone 4's Retina display. Apple continued hitting home runs with its custom chip adventures with the A5, A5X, A6, and all the way to today's industry leading A12X Bionic SoC inside its iPad Pro.

This stuff fascinates me to this day. Intel's venerable Skylake architecure (now very long in the tooth), AMD's Zen 2 and Navi architectures, IBM's POWER8, and Apple's SoCs and platform controllers -- all of it. I spend way too much reading it how these amazing pieces of technology are designed and built.

Back when I was an undergrad I decided to give up my dreams on becoming an electrical engineer and chip architect. I was told that I would need to study for at least a decade (B.Eng + M.Sc + PhD) to build up expertise in the area. Even then, I would have to go over the US, Japan, or Taiwan to find a job, and then I would have to compete against graduates from institutions such as CalTech, MIT, and Stanford. I decided that it was too long of a commitment.

I would, ironically, end up studying economics for over a decade!
