## About

The Honour Roll is a personal blog run by me. With a formal background in macroeconomics, a lot of the topics I like to share and discuss are of an economic and political nature. However, I'm also greatly intrigued by technology -- mostly the rumblings and news that comes out of Silicon Valley.

My contact details as well as full appointment history can be found from the following links:

I was born and raised in Perth, Australia, where I had a fairly quiet and working-class upbringing. My childhood was spent mostly on video games, reading fiction, watching sci-fi, and watching breakfast TV anime shows. Standard affair. Video games and an obsession with how things work led me to get into hobbyist PC building, and the start of my interest in technology -- specifically integrated circuits, semiconductors, and system design.

As I was graduating high school, my curiosity into how systems -- like an electrical circuit, combustion engine, or the solar system -- worked and operated, as well as my parents' constant financial struggles, led me to take up an interest in the study of economics. My parents were good intentioned hard working people, yet they would constantly undermine their hard work with irresponsible decisions or a lack of financial awareness. As an impressionable teenager, this always struck me as odd, and I could never understand why many people like my parents struggled to build wealth and financial success. I believed that by understanding how individuals make choices, and how the broader macroeconomy worked, I could resolve the puzzle that my family was in. Thus began my formal studies into economics.

During my undergrad years, I also undertook language, history, and international studies in Japan. Japan would continue to play an important role in my life and early career, and I continued to return to the country to visit relatives and friends each summer holiday. I can't quite put it into succinct enough words, but I have always had a love-hate relationship with Japan. Sometimes it feels like home away from home, sometimes it feels absolutely alien.

But economics remained front and centre my academic focus while at university. I did attempt to branch out into finance, banking, and even Chinese studies, but none of it stuck. Finance, particularly in the recovery period after the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, seemed like a massive fraud. Seemingly, none of the experts were able to do the fundamental requirement of their job: accurately price risk and assets. Furthermore, from my viewpoint, it was primarily central bankers equipped with economics PhDs that were cleaning up the systematic mess and disaster left behind in the wake of the GFC. It was around this time that I also began to explore more widely into politics and political thought. Given my working class roots and belief in the study of economics, it was only natural that I gravitated toward the likes of former Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating and other Machiavelli-like political figures.

I became increasingly curious and interested in individuals who held a strongly-held vision for how they believed the world worked or ought to work. My economic beliefs started to form by reading into John Locke, David Hume, John Maynard Keynes, and more contemporary work from Paul Samuelson, Robert Solow, Robert Lucas, and Thomas Piketty; and more generally I enjoyed the work of Christopher Hitchens, Ivan Illich, Paulo Freire, and A. C. Grayling. Mind you, my interest in visionaries reach beyond the realms of just economics and politics. Commercial visionaries Steve Jobs and his former-right hand man, Jony Ive, and scientists such as Alan Turing and Stephen Hawking also greatly interest me too.

I won't bore you with any career or academic details here. I think it's important that I explain how I view the world, and how I process the sheer amount of information we all come across on a day to day basis. Understanding how things work -- or the firm belief that we may have in how the world ought to work -- has continued to motivate and underline every decision I make, both in my career and personal life. Even when things may seem chaotic and disorderly, I believe it's all just one necessary journey towards a stable, new equilibrium.
